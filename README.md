## Getting Started

**This is an example of how you may give instructions on setting up your project locally.**
**Modify this file to match your project, remove sections that don't apply. For example: delete the testing section if the currect project doesn't require testing.**


To get a local copy up and running follow these simple example steps.

### Prerequisites

### Setup

Clone this repo into your local device by running the following command on your Terminal:
```
git clone https://github.com/eduardosancho/ConferencePage_Capstone.git
```

That will create a folder with the project inside it. Navigate into it to access the files.

### Install

### Usage

Before you begin testing and experimenting, remember to use the Terminal to create a branch by running:
```
git checkout -b branch-name
```
After that you should be ready to go.

### Run tests

Before pushing changes to your branch, I would recommend opening this file:

.github/workflows/linters.yml

install and run webhint, stylelint, and eslint

These linter will help you fit your code to this repo's syntax standard.

### Deployment

Once you're done with your changes, remember to ```git pull``` before doing ```git push``` this will update 
your local copy of the project if someone else made changes to the repo while you worked on your part.
